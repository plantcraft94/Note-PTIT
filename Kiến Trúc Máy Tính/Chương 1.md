# Computer architecture and organization

- Computer organization: the components and their operations of computers;
- Computer architecture: selection and connection of hardware components for achieving the following goals:
	- Performance and speed
	- Functionality
	- Cost

System Bus:
- Control
- Data
- Address
Peripherals:
- Input: Keyboard, Mouse, Disk Drives, Scanner
- Output: Monitor, Printer,...
CPU:
- ALU: Arithmetic and Logic Unit
- CU: Control Units
- Registers
# Memory
- Functions: stores instructions and data for CPU's processing
- Main types:
	- ROM (read only memory):
		- Sotres system instructions and data (interrupt routlines, boot loader,...)
		- Data in ROM is not lost without power.
	- RAM (random access memory)
		- Store system's and user's programs and data
		- Data on RAM are deleted if power supply stop
- RAM is the main memory type to store and load programs
